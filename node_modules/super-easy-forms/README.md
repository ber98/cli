Super Easy Forms is a tool that lets you create html forms in seconds (literally). It takes care of provisioning all the necessary backend resources for you in AWS, and it outputs a Bootstrap HTML form ready to copy paste into your static site.

**This is now the repo for Super Easy Forms 2.0. The First Version has been moved to [this other repo](https://github.com/gkpty/super-easy-forms-classic)**

## Pre-requisites

*  Make sure you have node.js and npm installed. You can checkout this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@lucaskay/install-node-and-npm-using-nvm-in-mac-or-linux-ubuntu-f0c85153e173) to install npm and node in mac, linux (debian/ubuntu).
* Have an AWS account and an IAM user with administrator access. If you don't have an AWS account, you can easily create one [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?#/start). Don't worry, everything you do with this project will fall within the AWS free tier limit! 

## Installation

`npm i super-easy-forms`
